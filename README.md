unity3d-detect-apple-device-model
=================================

Plug-in for Unity3d to get the Apple Mobile Device Model

Fixes Unity3d's iPhoneGeneration enum returning "unknown" for a bunch of phones.

It's easier to update a line of code than wait for Unity to release a new build with the newly released devices.
